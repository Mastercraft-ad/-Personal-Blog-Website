                <p>Have you ever asked yourself, 'What's next?' Knowing what's next can solve a multitude of problems, especially as a developer.</p>
                <p>Hi, I'm Moses, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. Learning the basics of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> at <strong>Trybe X Academy</strong> wasn't easy, but it was definitely fun ðŸ˜Š.</p>
                <p>What makes each task easier is knowing what's next. I sat down to create my roadmap, but I became confused at some point. It's crucial to know what's next in every project or learning process; otherwise, you might lose focus and waste time on unnecessary tasks ðŸ˜ª</p>
                <h4>Finallyâ€¦</h4>
                <p>Knowing what's next has saved me from losing focus and helped me concentrate on my roadmap. I encourage you to do the same in your personal projects. Make sure to plan ahead and know what's next to maximize your productivity.</p>
                <p>Thank you</p>
