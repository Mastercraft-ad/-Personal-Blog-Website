                <p>Life has been a journey. Every human must embrace everything it takes to succeed, making remarkable progress while learning. In this article, I'll walk you through my learning process with Trybe-X Bootcamp Week 1.</p>
                <p>Like I said, I'll be sharing my little knowledge on what I've learned so far at Trybe-X Academy during the first week of intensive tutorials with Mr. Qudus.</p>
                <p>Knowing the fundamentals of how the internet works is quite interesting and makes you want to learn more about the web. Without further ado, here are some beginner tips on what I’ve learned so far:</p>
    
                <h3>What you’ll read here:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#webtech">Introduction to Web Technologies</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#webdev-environment">Setting Up Your Development Environment</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#comandline">Basics of Command Line</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#workflow">Introduction to Web Development Workflow</a></li>
                </ol>
    
                <p>If you take a look at how the internet works, you’ll understand that the internet is the World Wide Web (WWW) and the interconnection of networks. With the help of the internet, users can easily access resources because of the interconnected networks.</p>
                <p>Without a URL (Universal Resource Locator), which uniquely identifies a server or website, users cannot access the internet. There must be a “Network A” and “Network B” interconnecting. This connection is not just for sharing information; it’s also for accessing information and resources online.</p>
    
                <h2 id="internet">Introduction to Web Technologies</h2>
                <p>Web technologies involve the advancement of how the internet has grown to develop various web platforms.</p>
                <p>Web is developed page by page using basic HTML and styled with CSS to provide information on each page created. Technology involves advanced programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, and others to ensure each page is interactive and functioning properly.</p>
    
                <h2 id="webdev-environment">Setting Up Your Development Environment</h2>
                <p>Setting up your development environment, or dev environment, involves preparing tools like IDEs, Git, and more for development.</p>
    
                <h2 id="comandline">Basics of Command Line</h2>
                <p>Command lines are text-based interfaces where you input commands to instruct the computer to perform specific tasks. These commands are often referred to as “prompts.”</p>
    
                <h2 id="workflow">Introduction to Web Development Workflow</h2>
                <p>The web development workflow involves structuring a complete and functioning web project. It begins with planning and designing the website or project.</p>
                <p>Planning involves setting goals and defining features, while designing focuses on creating a user interface or user experience. The next step is front-end development using HTML and CSS based on the design structure.</p>
                <p>API (Application Programming Interface) is crucial for connecting the front end with the backend, which is often developed using programming languages like PHP, Node.js, or Python.</p>
                <p>This is just the beginning of what I’ve learned during the first week of the Trybe-X Bootcamp. I hope this gives you a glimpse into the topics we’ve covered so far.</p>
